## Features
* Basic game structure which you can use for your own mobile game
* Runs on Android
* Possible to run on Desktop and Web, but needs additional modules
* Also possible to run on iOS, but needs a framework like [Intel MultiOS](https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/633261)

## Setup
* I recommend to use Android Studio which has a very good Kotlin support
* Import as a Gradle Project
